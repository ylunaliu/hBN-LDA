     Parallel version (MPI), running on    64 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     4 nodes
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      64
     485852 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts


     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./bn.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PZ
                           (   1   1   0   0   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
