# Required arguments #
######################

# Input file with DFT wavefunctions.
# The input WFN file is assumed to be in binary Fortran format.
# This file is controlled by the wfng_flag/wfng_file options in pw2bgw.inp
input_wfn_file WFN_in

# Output file to write DFT wavefunctions to.
# The output WFN file will be written in HDF5 format.
output_wfn_file WFN.h5

# Input file with self-consistent potential.
# This file is controlled by the vscg_flag/vscg_file options in pw2bgw.inp
vsc_file VSC

# Input file with Kleinman-Bylander projectors
# This file is controlled by the vkbg_flag/vkbg_file options in pw2bgw.inp
vkb_file VKB


############################
# Basic optional arguments #
############################

# Number of bands to generate. Default is -1, which generates bands up to
# the energy cutoff.
number_bands 2500

# Number of k-points pools. The total number of MPI tasks will distributed
# into this number of groups, each group working on a separate k-point.
number_pools 16

# Direct solvers (see the README for more information)
#   -2 = dummy, i.e., don't diagonalize. Useful to benchmark I/O.
#   -1 = default => 10 if compiled with ELPA, 0 otherwise
#    0 = Bisection
#    1 = Divide and Conquer
#    2 = Relatively Robust Representations/MR3 (needs special flags; see README)
#   10 = ELPA (typically best option, but need special linking; see README)
#  1xx = PRIMME (needs special linking; see notes below and README)
#solver_algorithm -1
